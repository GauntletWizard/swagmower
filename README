PS2Bot is an IRC bot that manages a channel full of Planetside 2 players.
Presumably, these players are all in the same outfit, and want to know
what each other are doing, and when a game session is running.  The leader
of the outfit may want to present information from time to time, and PS2Bot
will happily announce these things on a recurring basis.

If you don't want to do these exact things, you are likely better off writing
your own bot based on PircBotX, which is what PS2Bot is based on.  It is
simple, well-documented, and actively developed.

You will need the PircBotX jar file to run PS2Bot.

You will need the jsoup library to run PS2Bot.
